# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator*

**Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Bernard Wong**

Time spent: **~8** hours spent in total

## Functionality of the Application 
A basic tip calculator application was created with the help of CodePath's [tip calculator tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fokeaXUdoz8) and information from [Stanford's first iOS lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71pyOB4TPRE&vl=en-US). This application contains basic features for an application that calculates the bill which include: 

- the ability for a user to enter a bill amount 
- the ability for a user to choose a tip percentage 
- the ability to see the tip and total values. 

Along with this, a few additional features were added in. By researching different methods and learning from various sources such as Stanford's iOS lectures and stack overflow, I was able to learn a little bit more about how swift works and as a result was able to implement: 

- the ability for a user to enter in a tax amount that is also factored into the total bill 
- a scroller for users to choose a specific tip percentage in case they want to select another tip percentage other than the quick select tip percentages 
- additional information on how much the bill is if it is split amongst 2,3,4, or 5 people 
- a keyboard that is always visible so that the user can efficiently enter in information at all times 
- a visual cue of tip percentage, changing the app background to red if tip percentage ranges from 0-10%, yellow if tip percentage ranges from 10-20%, and green if tip percentage ranges from 20-100%. 
- an app icon and loading screen 

Changes occur whenever the bill/tax amount or tip percentages are changed in order to provide information as quickly as possible.
